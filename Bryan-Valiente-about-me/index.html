    <p>I am a rising junior who doesn't really know what to do with his life and goes along with the wind because he is too lazy to change it himself</p>

    <p>That is a really hard question to ask but generally I do want to become someone who does not have a bad reputation or someone who eventually went to jail for something because if that were to happen I would probably give up on trying at all </p>
    <h1 class="heading3">Hobbies and Interests?</h1>

    <p>I do like to do a lot of things but I am not good at any of them. I do like to read but only when they are interesting to me and when I can understand them, and I also really like swimming but it can get very terrifying.</p>
